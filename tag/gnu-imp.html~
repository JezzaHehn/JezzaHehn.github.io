<p>The GNU Image Manipulation Program is a free and open-source raster graphics editor used for image retouching and editing, free-form drawing, converting between different image formats, and more specialized tasks. The offical name "GIMP" was originally chosen by Spencer Kimball and Peter Mattis as a joke reference to the movie “Pulp Fiction”. The word “gimp” is also <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gimp">an ableist slur</a>, but the developers will not change the name of the software. According to their FAQ, "GIMP has been quite popular for a long time in search engine results" and the developers are concerned about the "sterilization of language."
  
  The Glimpse Image Editor was created in 2019 as an alternative fork.</p>
