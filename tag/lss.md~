[Lindenmayer Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) are very accessible fractals to the lay person. Their underlying logic is as easy as Sudoku. This app takes a cool visual from the complicated math world and makes it fun to play around with. While other L-System Apps require complicated screens, this one lets you type and instantly preview the output.
