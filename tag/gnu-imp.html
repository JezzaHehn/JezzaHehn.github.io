<p>The GNU Image Manipulation Program is a free and open-source raster graphics editor used for image retouching and editing, free-form drawing, converting between different image formats, and more specialized tasks. The offical name "GIMP" was originally chosen by Spencer Kimball and Peter Mattis as a joke reference to the movie “Pulp Fiction”. The word “gimp” is also <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gimp">an ableist slur</a>, but <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gimp">according to their FAQ,</a> "GIMP has been quite popular for a long time in search engine results." The developers feel that the "sterilization of language will do more harm than good" and so will not change the name of the software.</p>

<p>The Glimpse Image Editor was created in 2019 as an alternative fork with more widely acceptable branding.</p>
